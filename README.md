Hydroponics, a soil-less cultivation technique, offers efficient resource utilization and enhanced crop yields. However, precise control of water quality is essential to ensure optimal nutrient absorption and successful crop growth. 
This project presents a comprehensive IoT-based water quality monitoring system specifically designed for hydroponics, incorporating pH, turbidity, and temperature sensors. The system is capable of data acquisition from sensors, data processing, and data visualization in real time. The sensor data is seamlessly transmitted from Arduino to ESP8266 and securely stored on the ThingSpeak cloud platform. Utilizing web scraping techniques, the collected data is extracted from ThingSpeak and seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly website. On the website, a machine learning (ML) model, trained on required data, automatically processes the real-time sensor readings and performs crop suitability predictions. 
The system enables continuous and automated monitoring of key water quality parameters, ensuring optimal conditions for hydroponic crop growth. The deployed ML model demonstrates remarkable performance in predicting water suitability for different crops.
By utilizing the data, the model provides real-time predictions on the website, empowering hydroponic farmers with data-driven insights to optimize crop selection based on water quality. To evaluate the systemâ€™s efficacy, extensive experimentation, and validation have been conducted using hydroponic setups with various crop types.
